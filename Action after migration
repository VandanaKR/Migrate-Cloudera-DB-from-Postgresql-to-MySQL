Ensure cloudera server db config file[/etc/cloudera-scm-server/db.properties] reflects the details of mysql.
If using cloudera versions less than CDH-5.4.x,then you need to perform following actions as defined in steps [a-f].
(a) Disable Zookeeper ACL authentication Temporarily in case of kerberised cluster
=> Login as admin user using default password. Navigate to Zookeeper service → Configuration choose, "Java Configuration Options for ZooKeeper Server".
=> Add this property to reset the super digest authentication: -Dzookeeper.DigestAuthenticationProvider.superDigest=super:cY+9eK20soteVC3fQ83SXDvwlP0=
(b) Start the Zookeeper from cloudera manager
(c) Remove zookeeper znode /hadoop-ha
(d) Enable zookeeper authentication: Remove -D property added in step3(a) ie, Zookeeper's java configuration snippet.
(e) Restart the zookeeper service from Cloudera manager.
(f) Intialize Automatic Failover Znode 
=> Navigate to HDFS → Instances → Select a failover contoller. Then go to Actions → Intialize Automatic Failover Znode
Start all the services.
Modify database details in Cloudera management service Configuration
=> Navigate to Cloudera Management service → Configuration.Change all Monitoring service Databases as mysql.
Change the admin password as required. [as Cloudera-DB migration has reset the admin password to default 'admin'].
If required, to avoid later contention, you can remove cloudera-server-db using: yum erase cloudera-manager-server-db
